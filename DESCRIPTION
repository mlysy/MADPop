Description: Tools for the analysis of population differences using the
        Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genotypes of samples
        having a variable number of alleles (1-4) recorded for each
        individual.  A hierarchical Dirichlet-Multinomial model on the
        genotype counts is used to pool small samples from multiple
        populations for pairwise tests of equality.  Bayesian inference
        is implemented via the 'rstan' package.  Bootstrapped and
        posterior p-values are provided for chi-squared and likelihood
        ratio tests of equal genotype probabilities.
