Description: Tools for the analysis of two models for fish populations with a
    variable number of alleles (2 to 4). One implements the basic Hardy-Weinberg
    equilibrium and the other, a random effects model which pools over ecologically
    similar sampling environments. Parameters are estimated using efficient Bayesian
    posterior sampling algorithms as implemented in stan. Bootstrapped p-value
    estimates for tests of equality between populations are also provided.
